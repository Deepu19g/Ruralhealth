			<h2>POISONING</h2>
			<div class="contents">
			1. Try to make sure that the person has indeed been poisoned. It may be hard to tell. <br>
			Some signs include chemical-smelling breath, burns around the mouth, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or unusual odors on the person. <br>
			If possible, identify the poison.<br>
			2. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional.<br>
			3. If the person vomits, clear the person's airway. Wrap a cloth around your fingers before cleaning out the mouth and throat.<br>
			 If the person has been sick from a plant part, save the vomit. It may help experts identify what medicine can be used to help reverse the poisoning.<br>
			4. If the person starts having convulsions, give convulsion first aid.
			5. Keep the person comfortable. The person should be rolled onto the left side, and remain there while getting or waiting for medical help.
			6. If the poison has spilled on the person's clothes, remove the clothing and flush the skin with water.
