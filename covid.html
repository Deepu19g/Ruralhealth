            </div>
            <div class="subtopic-content">
                <p>COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people, mainly when an infected
                    person is in close contact with another person .<br>

                    The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they
                    cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily.<br>

                    Transmission can occur particularly in indoor, crowded and
                    inadequately ventilated spaces, where infected person(s) spend long periods of time with others.
                    <br>

                    The virus can also spread after infected people sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, or objects,
                    such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. <br>

            <div class="subtopic-content">
                <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to
                    moderate
                    illness
                    and recover without hospitalization.<br><br>

                    Most common symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Dry cough</li>
                    <li>Tiredness</li>
                </ul>
                Less common symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Aches and pains</li>
                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                    <li>Diarrhoea</li>
                    <li>Conjunctivitis</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>Loss of taste or smell.</li>
                    <li>Rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.</li>
                </ul>
                Serious symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
                    <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
                </ul>
                Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor
                or health
                facility.<br>

                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.<br>

                On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however
                it can take up to 14 days.

            <div class="subtopic-content">
                Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally:
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        The United Kingdom (UK)  - variant called B.1.1.7 with a large number of mutations. It has been detected in many countries around the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In South Africa, another variant called B.1.351 emerged independently of B.1.1.7 but shares some
                        mutations with B.1.1.7. Cases caused by this variant have been reported in the US.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In Brazil, a variant called P.1 emerged. This variant contains a set of additional mutations
                        that may affect its ability to be recognized by antibodies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases
                of COVID-19. <br>
                So far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorized vaccines
                recognize these variants. This is being closely investigated and more studies are underway.
