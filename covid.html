        <h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic-content">
        <p>COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people, mainly when an infected person is
            in
            close contact with another person.<br><br>

            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
            sneeze,
            speak, sing or breathe heavily. These liquid particles are different sizes, ranging from larger ‘respiratory
            droplets’ to smaller ‘aerosols’.<br><br>

            Other people can catch COVID-19 when the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes, which is more likely to
            happen when people are in direct or close contact (less than 1 metre apart) with an infected person.<br><br>

            Current evidence suggests that the main way the virus spreads is by respiratory droplets among people who
            are in
            close contact with each other.<br><br>

            Aerosol transmission can occur in specific settings, particularly in indoor, crowded and inadequately
            ventilated
            spaces, where infected person(s) spend long periods of time with others, such as restaurants, choir
            practices,
            fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and/or places of worship. More studies are underway to better
            understand
            the conditions in which aerosol transmission is occurring outside of medical facilities where specific
            medical
            procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, are conducted.<br><br>

            The virus can also spread after infected people sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, or objects, such as
            tables,
            doorknobs and handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these contaminated surfaces, then
            touching
            their eyes, noses or mouths without having cleaned their hands first.<br><br>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic-content">
        <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate
            illness
            and recover without hospitalization.

            Most common symptoms:
        <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Dry cough</li>
            <li>Tiredness</li>
        </ul>
        Less common symptoms:
        <ul>
            <li>Aches and pains</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Diarrhoea</li>
            <li>Conjunctivitis</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Loss of taste or smell.</li>
            <li>Rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.</li>
        </ul>
        Serious symptoms:
        <ul>
            <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
            <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
            <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
        </ul>
        Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health
        facility.

        People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.

        On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can
        take
        up to 14 days.

    <div class="sutopic-content">
        <p>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.
            <li>Avoid touching your face.
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
