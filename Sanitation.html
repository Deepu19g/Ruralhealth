              Community hygiene helps prevent infectious diseases from spreading
              throughout a neighborhood, school, compound, office space, and
              more. Hygiene practiced regularly creates healthier communities
            </li>
            <li>
              The primary cause of diarrhea is unsafe water and a lack of basic
              sanitation and hygiene. Itâ€™s entirely preventable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not only does community and environmental hygiene help protect
              young children, it reduces illness for everyone. Families are
              healthy and more productive. Children spend more time in school
              rather than recovering from illness

          <h1>Some sanitation practices</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways to reduce the
              spread of disease. You should especially wash your hands before
              and after you eat, after going to the bathroom and when you come
              into contact with someone who is sick. In order to achieve
              effective results, make sure you wash your hands properly.
            </li>
            <li>Using a toilet to keep feces separate from people</li>
            <li>Washing bodies regularly to maintain physical cleanliness</li>
            <li>
              Cover Your Mouth When Your Cough or Sneeze: This is extremely
              important to avoid spreading germs to people around you
            </li>
            <li>Water should be treated with alum (phitkari) before storage</li>
            <li>
              Properly dispose and treat sewage before releasing them.When water
              is exposed to untreated sewage it becomes a breeding ground for
              parasites and water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery,
              e.coli, and salmonella
            </li>
