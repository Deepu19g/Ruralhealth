		<h3>CHOKING</h3>
		<div class="contents">
			1. Stand behind them and slightly to one side. Support their chest with 1 hand.<br>
			Lean them forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.<br>
			2. Give up to 5 sharp blows between their shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. The heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist. <br>
			3. Check if the blockage has cleared.<br>
			4. If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts.<br>

		<h3>CHEST PROBLEMS</h3>
		<div class="contents">
			If you’re going to give someone CPR, phone 999 first.<br>
			To carry out a chest compression:<br>
			1. Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person’s chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers.<br>
			2. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5-6cm on their chest.<br>
			3.Repeat this until the ambulance arrives.<br>
			Try to do the chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions a minute.<br>
			CPR is not as hard as you may think. Just phone 999 and then push hard and fast.<br>

		<h3>HEAD INJURY</h3>
		<div class="contents">
			Severe head injuries require immediate medical attention. Anyone who sees someone with symptoms of a severe head injury should call 911 or their local emergency number.<br>
			It is best not to move a person with a severe head injury to avoid making their injuries worse. People should also not attempt to remove a person’s helmet if they are wearing one.<br>
			Severe head injuries often require a stay in the hospital, surgery, or long-term treatment.<br>
